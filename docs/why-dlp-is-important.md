# Why is DLP Important?

DLP policies are essential for safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining compliance with organizational security guidelines. Without DLP:
- Sensitive data may be unintentionally shared with external services.
- Security breaches can occur due to unmonitored data transfers.
- Compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) may be violated.
